To whom it may concern,
Greetings! I am writing to tell you about some concerns regarding the password policy for your organization. With access to username : password-hash combinations, I was able to decrypt a majority of your users’ passwords. Some of them were very common like ortspoon’s “123456”. The way that I did this was run the hash against a word list and tested to see if their hashes were the same. Since 123456 is already in my growing list, and the hash of 123456 is known, it is simple for anyone to “undo” to get the password in plain text. The encryption method that your organization used was MD5, which is outdated and less secure than more contemporary solutions like SHA-256. 
On the topic of password complexity, my method involved comparing the hashes to the hashes passwords I expected to find. What this means is that I suggest you prompt your users to try to create unique passwords, and give them some guidance in what this means. Some examples of password security include case-sensitivity, numbers, symbols, combinations of words, etc. This is not to be confused with “unique” passwords like g0ldf!sh, where letters are exchanged with their common symbol counterparts. Instead, companies like Verizon provide passwords for their customers like “tomdisctossgrass3049”. In its individual parts, it may seem like an “easy” password, but what makes it difficult for a computer is the combination of words. For a human, it is easy to imagine “tom tossing a disc over the grass” + 3049. 
Thank you for your time, and I hope you incorporate some of these changes to ensure user security.
Sincerely, 
Jibran Absarulislam
